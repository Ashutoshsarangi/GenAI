# LLM Large Language Model

# LLMs are a type of AI model that can generate human-like text based on the input they receive.
# They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a variety of language tasks, 
# such as translation, summarization, and conversation.

# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Token

# A token is a unit of text that the model processes.
# In natural language processing, tokens can be words, subwords, or characters.

# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Context In Terms of LLMs

# Context refers to the surrounding text or information that helps the model understand the meaning of a given input.
# In LLMs, context is crucial for generating relevant and coherent responses.

# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Prediction

# Prediction is the process of generating text based on the input and context provided to the model.

# ChatGpt is limiting the token size based on the model type
# Gemini having the token size of 1 million
#     hence you can ask/give more data to process and share result

#Limitation of LLMs
# 1. Limited understanding of context: LLMs may struggle to understand complex or nuanced contexts, leading to irrelevant or incoherent responses.
# 2. Hallucinations: LLMs can generate false or misleading information, which can be problematic in certain applications.
# 3. Ethical concerns: LLMs can inadvertently generate biased or harmful content, raising ethical concerns about their use.
# 4. Token Size Exceed: LLMs have a maximum token size, which limits the amount of text they can process at once. This can be a challenge when working with large documents or datasets.
