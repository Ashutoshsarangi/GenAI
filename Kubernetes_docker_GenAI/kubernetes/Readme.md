1. From Within a Kubernetes Pod (Inter-Pod Communication):

Yes, you absolutely can! Kubernetes automatically provides DNS resolution for Services.

How it works: Every Service gets a DNS name within the cluster. The format is typically <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local. If the Pod making the request is in the same namespace as the Service, you can often just use <service-name>.

Steps to test:
a.  Create a temporary test Pod:
yaml # test-pod.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: debug-client spec: containers: - name: debugger image: busybox:latest # A small image with basic network tools command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"] # Keep it running 
bash kubectl apply -f test-pod.yaml 

b.  Exec into the test Pod:
bash kubectl exec -it debug-client -- sh 

c.  Ping or curl your Service from inside debug-client:
```bash
# Try pinging the service name
ping my-genai-app-service

  # Try curling your application
  curl http://my-genai-app-service:80/ 
 # did not work

 ```
2. From Outside the Kubernetes Cluster:

If you want to access your application from your local machine or the internet, you'll need to change your Service type.

NodePort (for testing/development):
    Then, find the NodePort: kubectl get svc my-genai-app-service   
    It will show you the PORT(S) like 80:3xxxx/TCP. You can then access it at 
    http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>. (Did not work as well)
